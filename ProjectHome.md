# PHP based Rule Engine #
## for business applications written in PHP ##

**phpRulez** is going to be the rule-engine of choice for professional PHP Applications.

(For a quick introduction to rule engines see: [InfoQ: Real-World Rule Engines](http://www.infoq.com/articles/Rule-Engines))

To build professional business applications the business processes must be represented in the application.

These can of course be hard-coded or based on different coded modules.

Business needs are different though. Businesses need to adopt fast to new circumstances and the business people that have the knowledge about processes most of the times are not skilled programmers.

The java-world knows many Rule Engines, for example [JBoss Rules](http://www.jboss.com/products/rules) to just mention one.


This project wants to provide the PHP world with a flexible rule engine. This basic business need is missing in the PHP world to create realworld, serious business applications
